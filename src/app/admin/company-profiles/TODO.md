## TODO

- [x] Add "Are you sure you want to exit job creation?" confirmation modal when closing with unsaved changes
- [x] Change place of assignment to a dropdown (Paranaque, Las Pinas) in PostJobsModal.tsx
- [x] Option to manually change a company profile as inactive (this results in a company profile being archived, it could say set as inactive and archive. This also means any current job postings will not appear anymore for the user for this company)
