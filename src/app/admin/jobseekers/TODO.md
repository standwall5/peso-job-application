## TODO
- [x] Implement search functionality for jobseekers
- [x] Add pagination for jobseeker list
- [x] Implement sorting options for jobseeker list (probably better to utilize the CSS of the  sort in @/components)
- [x] Add archive jobseeker (the select feature was supposed to be that but we are changing it to a button instead)
- [x] Add archives tab (contains archived jobseekers)
- [ ] Fix jobseeker dropdown (does not correctly retrieve applications)
- [ ] Rework referral letter rich text editor feature (backup old file of the referral letter so there's fallback if attempted new rework fails)
