## TODO: 
- [X] Implement withdraw application feature (should also exist in /profile).
- [X] User's existing and current ID should be shown on every job app, it is shown always and each option/type of ID is saved the first time they are set. It will always be previewed (if set) and of course user has option to change ID and that changed ID will now be the one shown everywhere.
- [X] Add view id (with ability to edit) in application modal instead of showing application submitted
- [X] Refactor Verified ID (700+ lines to 200+)
- [X] Test ID feature after implementation
- [X] Based on the user's skills, jobs should be matched, meaning job creation should now include skills related. Solution could be to add the same skill adding solution present in resume editing in job creation but it is skill input is now restricted to only what is present in a created list. This list will be comprehensive. So basically user will type something and will only stay in the input if they click on the result that appeared on the dropdown or if its exact.
- [X] Add a side panel that shows jobs recommended (determined by skills how many skills match)
- [X] This job recommended should have an option to view more.
- [X] In the job-opportunities page, where companies are at the top, there should be a section at the bottom of it where it shows all jobs and it's also filtered by the reworked search feature (see TODO.md in /search)



## NOTICE: Edit feature is not needed because user cannot edit anything in the application that requries a new function (edit resume and upload ID already exist within profile and will be added to the ID Modal)
