## TODO

- [x] Ensure reports in admin is working correct
- [ ] implement the same profile icon in user for admins (put the profile icon in header for admin).
- [ ] implement dropdown when clicking profile icon in header
- [ ] move change password and change profile into one modal (by clicking the profile icon user and clicking the dropdown that says profile)
- [ ] jobseekser
- [ ] implement deployed jobseekers system (if jobseeker is marked as deployed they will be moved to the deployed page)
- [ ] make a deployed jobseekers page (exact design as archived jobseekers, admin has option to also change status of jobseeker to not deployed)
- [ ] if applicant is deployed, they will be able to access the system but if they try to click on a job card, application modal wont appear, instead a notice modal will appear saying "You don't have access to the website as you are currently deployed.
      If you wish to re-apply
      <button>Chat with Admin</button>(opens chat widget if clicked)"

- [ ] Make sure ID is viewable on admin side (sharp keeps failing on vercel, please dont recommend to turn off image optimizations or an npm install)
